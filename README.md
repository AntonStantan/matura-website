# Neural Predictive Calculator Website

This is the official website for the Neural Predictive Calculator research project, which investigates the arithmetic capabilities of neural networks.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The Neural Predictive Calculator is a maturaarbeit (graduation thesis) project that evaluates why neural networks struggle with simple arithmetic expressions. The project builds and tests various neural network architectures including:

- Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Attention-based RNNs
- Transformers
- Pre-trained Fine-tuned Transformers (Gemma, Gemini)

## 🚀 Website Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on all devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with smooth animations
- **Interactive Elements**: Animated sections, hover effects, and smooth scrolling
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Links to all research materials and findings
- **Code Demo**: Instructions for running the best performing model (FNN2)
